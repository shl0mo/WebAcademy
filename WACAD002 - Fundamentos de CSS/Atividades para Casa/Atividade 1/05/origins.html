		AFTER having been twice driven back by heavy southwestern gales, Her Majesty's ship Beagle, a ten-gun 
		brig, under the command of Captain Fitz Roy, R. N., sailed from Devonport
		on the 27th of December, 1831. The object of the expedition was to complete the survey of
		Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826 to 1830, -- to survey
		the shores of Chile, Peru, and of some islands in the Pacific -- and to carry a chain of
		chronometrical measurements round the World. On the 6th of January we reached Teneriffe,
		but were prevented landing, by fears of our bringing the cholera: the next morning we saw the
		sun rise behind the rugged outline of the Grand Canary island, and suddenly illuminate the Peak
		of Teneriffe, whilst the lower parts were veiled in fleecy clouds. This was the first of many
		delightful days never to be forgotten. On the 16th of January, 1832, we anchored at Porto
		Praya, in St. Jago, the chief island of the Cape de Verd archipelago.
