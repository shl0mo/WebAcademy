		<p>WHEN on board H.M.S. Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution 
		of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants 
		of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species &mdash; that 
		mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it 
		occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently 
		accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five 
		years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 
		1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present 
		day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal 
		details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.</p>
